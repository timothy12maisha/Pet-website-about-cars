            right solution for the light-duty, medium-duty and heavy-duty truck segments. Again and again, the
            pioneering spirit at Mercedes-Benz Trucks has generated groundbreaking innovations â€“ from efficient drives

        <p>The Toyota Dyna is a medium-duty cab over truck for commercial use. In the Japanese market, the Dyna is sold
            alongside its twin called the Toyoace. The Toyoace was a renaming of the Toyopet SKB Truck as a result of a
            1956 public competition with 200,000 entries. "Dyna" is short for dynamic.</p>
